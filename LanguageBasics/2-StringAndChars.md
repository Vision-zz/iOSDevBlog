# Strings and Characters

A string is just a bunch of characters grouped together such as `"Hello"`, it can be initialized with either String literals or the String constructor.

By default the type of a variable is `String` even if it contains a single character. A variable must be declared with either explicit type annotation with `Character` type or should be initialized with the `Character` constructor to declare the variable's type as `Character`

```swift
var a = "A" // Type 'String'
var b = String("B") // Type 'String'
var c: Character = "C" // Type 'Character'
var d = Character("D") // Type 'Character'
```
