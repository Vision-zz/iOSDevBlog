# Swift
Language used to create iOS and OSX applications

## Do you like Swift?
Yes

### Why?
The short answer is that I found the syntax to be easier

The long answer however could be of multiple reasons. One being the fact that it is too similar to JavaScript and I already know JS to a extent. In general I am more used to Scripting languages and find it easier to work with. Plus the idealogy of having automatically inferred types is what I like. And Swift does just that.
