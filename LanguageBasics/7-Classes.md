# Classes

A class is a blueprint of a object. Classes are similar to structures in most ways. But they both differ in some parts

- Classes are reference types while structs are value types.
- Classes support inheritance and typecasting.
- Classes have deinitializers.

```swift
class ClassName {
	// class definition
}
```
